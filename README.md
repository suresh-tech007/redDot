##  Real-Time Betting System

### Overview

### Features
1. **Real-Time Communication**
   - Socket.IO is used to broadcast real-time updates to all users.
   
2. **Multiple Timers**
   - Separate betting windows for 1Min, 3Min, 5Min, and 10Min intervals.
   - Timers reset with a unique 14-digit game ID.

3. **Betting Logic**
   - Accepts multiple selected numbers and colors.
   - Results are calculated based on the least amount of money placed on a number.

4. **Game History**
   - Stores game details (GameID, selected numbers, user bets, results, etc.) in MongoDB.

5. **Dynamic Wallet Management**
   - Deducts money first from the deposit balance and then from the withdrawable balance.
